print(2 + 2) # This is an expression as it had 2 numbers seperated by an operator
print('\n')

# There are many operators such as ...
# Exponent (**), e.g 2**3 = 8
# Modulus/remainder (%), e.g 22%8 = 6
# Integer division/floored quotient (//), e.g 22//8 = 2
# Division (/), e.g 22/8 = 2.75
# Multiplication (*), e.g 3*5 = 15
# Addition (+), e.g 2+2 = 4
# Bedmass also is followed in python

# The Integer, Floating-Point, and String Data Types
# A data type is a category fo values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type
# Some of the most common data types include integers, floating point numbers, and strings

# We can use "+" operator on strings to concatinate them together
# If we use one 2 strings it will work fine, but using it on an int and string will cause an error
# The "*" operator can be used to repeate a string a certian number of time and can only be a string concatinated with an integer
