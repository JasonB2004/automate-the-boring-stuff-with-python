print(2 + 2) # This is an expression as it had 2 numbers seperated by an operator
print('\n')

# There are many operators such as ...
# Exponent (**), e.g 2**3 = 8
# Modulus/remainder (%), e.g 22%8 = 6
# Integer division/floored quotient (//), e.g 22//8 = 2
# Division (/), e.g 22/8 = 2.75
# Multiplication (*), e.g 3*5 = 15
# Addition (+), e.g 2+2 = 4
# Bedmass also is followed in python
